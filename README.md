# Home-Automation
The basic purpose of the project is to demonstrate how a user can remotely control his appliances via cell phone and the illustration of the smart metering technique. A GSM module or a mobile phone is interfaced with the TM4C123 microcontroller. This cell phone acts as bridge for communication between the user and the microcontroller. The user sends a specified command via his cell phone to that connected with the controller. The controller reads this signal and based upon the instructions given in the SMS by the user, the microcontroller turns on or off the appliances according to the users wish. Two UARTS are being conﬁgured for controlling through TIVA. • UART0 • UART2 GPIO pin PA6 is conﬁgured in tristate mode.Output is being provided to the bulb through low level trigger relay.
